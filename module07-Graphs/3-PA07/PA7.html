<h2 id="changing-to-a-adjacency-matrix-representation">Changing to a adjacency matrix representation</h2>
<p>We mentioned in the Module 7 reading that there are two main options for representing a graph in our code: an adjacency list representation and an adjacency matrix representation. In the reading and the sample code, we used the adjacency list representation. In this assignment, you will convert our <code>Graph</code> class to use an adjacency matrix representation instead.</p>
<p>The original class had a pointer to an array of pointers to linked lists, so that the representation of this graph,</p>
<p><img src="https://doane.instructure.com/files/987106/download?download_frd=1" alt="BFS sample graph" title="BFS sample graph"/></p>
<p>would be eight lists, like this:</p>
<pre><code>1: [(2, 1), (5, 1), ]
2: [(1, 1), (6, 1), ]
3: [(6, 1), (7, 1), (4, 1), ]
4: [(3, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), ]
5: [(1, 1), ]
6: [(2, 1), (3, 1), (7, 1), ]
7: [(3, 1), (4, 1), (6, 1), (8, 1), ]
8: [(4, 1), (7, 1), ]</code></pre>
<p>Each entry in a list is an <code>AdjEntry</code> object, with two numbers: the <em>v</em> component in an edge <em>(u, v)</em>, and the weight of the edge <em>(u, v)</em>.</p>
<p>In the adjacency matrix representation, we will have a 2D array of doubles storing the weights of each edge. If there is no edge for a given row and column position, we will store an ∞. So, the adjacency matrix representation of the graph pictured above would be:</p>
<p><img src="https://doane.instructure.com/files/988958/download?download_frd=1" alt="Adjacency matrix representation" title="Adjacency matrix representation"/></p>
<p>We have an extra row and column because we start numbering vertices at one instead of at zero.</p>
<h3 id="files-in-the-directory">Files in the directory</h3>
<p><code>BFSDemo.cpp</code> : the breadth-first demo application from the Module's reading. The app should find the same path as it did before once you've completed the assignment.</p>
<p>'DijkstraDemo.cpp` : the Dijkstra's algorithm demo application from the Module's reading. The app should find the same path as it did before once you've completed the assignment.</p>
<p><code>dir.txt</code>, <code>undir.txt</code> : data files read by the demo apps.</p>
<p><code>Graph.hpp</code> : copy of the graph code from the Module's reading. This is the file you should modify.</p>
<p><code>GraphTests.cpp</code> : phantom main program file for making the <code>GraphTests</code> unit test application.</p>
<p><code>makefile</code> : makefile for building the unit test and demo apps.</p>
<h3 id="instructions">Instructions</h3>
<p><em>[Note: the code for PA07 will not compile with the files as delivered.]</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Edit <code>Graph.hpp</code> and search for the <code>TODO</code> comments. Complete the following tasks:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Write the constructor, to allocate a <code>(numV + 1) × (numV + 1)</code> array of doubles, <code>pMatrix</code>, that serves as the adjacency matrix.</p></li>
<li><p>Write the destructor, to free the memory used by <code>pMatrix</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish the implementation of the <code>addEdge</code> method so it uses the adjacency matrix implementation.</p></li>
<li><p>Modify the distance-adjusting code in the <code>Dijkstra</code> method so it uses the adjacency matrix implementation.</p></li>
<li><p>Modify the <code>numEdges</code> code so it uses the adjacency matrix implementation.</p></li>
<li><p>Build the project and execute the <code>GraphTests</code> unit tests. Make sure they all pass.</p></li>
<li><p>Execute the demo apps to verify that they find the same paths as before.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Before submitting your code, execute the <code>make clean</code> command to remove the executables and any object files.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the unit tests pass and the application produces the expected results, zip the entire <code>3-PA7</code> directory and submit the resulting .zip file via this assignment.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>
<p>You will receive one point for the assignment if all the Pass criteria in the attached rubric are met; otherwise, you will receive zero points for the assignment.</p>
